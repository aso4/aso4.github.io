description: Through command line scripting, users with pre-defined accounts can create and destroy lists and items over which they have ownership, and the results will be returned in JSON format. The main the challenges I encountered were creating serializer-based tests and modifying the database to match user story specifications. Click the Demo button for instructions on how to use a live version of the API.
