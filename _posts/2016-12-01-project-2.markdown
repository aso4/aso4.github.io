demo:
description: Because of its API-centered focus, this is not your average To-Do List app. Via command line scripting, users with pre-defined accounts can create and destroy lists and items. The big challenge in this project was creating tests using serializers due to the relationality of the database. As the user specifications regarding the database changed, I found myself having to modify database tables several times, adding relations and new properties.
tools: Rails, RSpec, Shoulda, Figaro, Pry, ActiveModel Serializers, Faker, Spring, FactoryGirl
