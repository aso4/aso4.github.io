description: This Rails-based Wikipedia clone helped to reinforce versioning and test-driven development concepts. Multiple dependencies were integrated purposes of handling new user registrations with email confirmation and password editing, enabling user self-upgrading/downgrading via online payment registration, and enabling Markdown-based editing of entries. Users in the premium tier have private wiki creation and collaborator add/remove functionality. The primary challenge from this project was the integration of new features via test-driven development.
tools: Rails, RSpec, Stripe, Faker, Devise, Figaro, Pundit, Redcarpet, Shoulda, Bootstrap
