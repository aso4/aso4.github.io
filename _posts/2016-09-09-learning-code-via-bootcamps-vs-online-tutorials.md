title: Learning Code Via Bootcamps Vs. Online Tutorials
---

HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, Angular. A few months ago, I wasn't even aware of what some of those were, much less describe how they work in the context of a web app. The amount of material that I've covered in this bootcamp has been incredible, and will be for any reputable in-person or online bootcamp. But the question is, do you really learn how to program?

The short answer is that it depends on what your idea of "programming" is. Different languages do different things because they follow different [programming paradigms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm). When I was going through the Fundamentals of Programming course in Coursera, everything was done in Python. Because I'd already gone through the Python course in Codecademy, I already had an idea of how to declare variables and loop through arrays and dictionaries. The Coursera curriculum was designed in a way that introduced new algorithms, making use of looping and declarations, building towards a mini final project.

Coding bootcamps are a different beast because you're being exposed to a much larger scope of what languages are capable of doing in a shorter amount of time and how they relate to each other in the context of a front-facing web app. The biggest difference is exposure to different types of data structures and APIs. Because of this, I've found that some of my learning has taken place because I've tried to ask better questions instead of showing my mentor a piece of code and asking them what was wrong with it. By putting my questions into better contexts, I can better understand where errors are occurring and how to go about fixing them.

Much like learning anything else of significance, it's a process. It's the process of sitting down, being equipped with the right debugging tools, and being patient with consistent effort. I might not know every nuance of Javascript or Angular, but because I have solid ideas and practice with coding in these different languages and frameworks, I can ask better questions. That, to me, is a demonstration of how Bloc's curriculum and mentorship program has been successful for other students.
