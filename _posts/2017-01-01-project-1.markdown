demo:
description: Ruby Voice Flashcards is a voice-based flashcard skill testing Ruby knowledge on the Amazon Alexa platform. The main challenges of this project was examining documentation. I started with Alexa developer documentation to see how skills could be implemented. Since most developer resources were written in JavaScript, I had to research and modify third-party dependencies to generate appropriate Alexa requests. Since Alexa also communicates via SSL tunneling, the third big hurdle was researching SSL tunnel hosts, bringing me deeper into the orbit of the AWS ecosystem.
tools: Rails, AWS Alexa, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS IAM, AWS Lambda, ngrok, Google API Client, Google Signet, Alexa Web Service gem, Alexa Rubykit gem
