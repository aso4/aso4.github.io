demo:
description: Ruby Voice Flashcards is a voice-based flashcard skill for Amazon Alexa. Virtually all Alexa developer templates have been written in JavaScript, so the big challenge for this project was finding open source code with enough functionality that would allow me to build the interface. Alexa also uses secure tunneling to communicate, which brought ngrok, Elastic Beanstalk, and a host of AWS services into the picture.
tools: Rails, AWS Alexa, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS IAM, AWS Lambda, ngrok, Google API Client, Google Signet, Alexa Web Service gem, Alexa Rubykit gem
