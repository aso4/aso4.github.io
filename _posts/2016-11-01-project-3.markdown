demo:
description: This client accesses data available through the Bloc.io API using student login credentials and processes it from JSON to Ruby hash format. Assuming valid credentials, a user can access data that pertains to those credentials such as student profile data, course curriculum, and internal messaging, as well as make Github-linked assignment submissions. Test automation was a challenge as API responses were cached to increase test speed and consistency and to eliminate repeated calls to the API.
tools: Ruby, RSpec, VCR, WebMock, Figaro, HTTParty, JSON, dotenv
