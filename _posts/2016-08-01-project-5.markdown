  BuzzJams is a single-page music player app designed using media query CSS assignment and Angular 1.5  <a href="https://toddmotto.com/opinionated-angular-js-styleguide-for-teams/">Angular 1.5 design principles</a>. This project marks my first taste integrating a third-party API, Buzz, into a JavaScript-based framework. Buzz is used to include and manage sounds, which in the case of BuzzJams means real-time playback and volume control. Tested and deployed via Grunt task runner, Node, and Heroku.
tools: Angular, Angular UI router, jQuery, Buzz, CSS, Grunt, Node
