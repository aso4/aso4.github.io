  BlocJams is a single-page music player app designed using responsive design principles and AngularJS. Using the Angular UI router and <a href="https://toddmotto.com/opinionated-angular-js-styleguide-for-teams/">Angular 1.5 design principles</a>, users have access to a navigation bar that routes to the app's Library page. This project was my first taste using a third-party API, Buzz, which was used to handle playback and volume control on the backend.
tools: Angular, Angular UI router, jQuery, Buzz, CSS, Grunt, Node
