title: Bootcamp Challenges as a Fledgling Programmer
---

Code bootcamps throw a lot of information at you at once with the hope that things stick. As an ESL teacher-turned-programmer who started taking baby steps with codecademy and coursera, getting used to the expectations of Bloc's weekly deadlines and assignments was a big adjustment.

Over the course of doing Bloc's online bootcamp, there have been a number of hard-to-understand concepts and code snippets that have made me turn to other sources of information for further explanation. At this point, about the 33 percent mark in the curriculum, I'd say the best sources of info for me have been stackexchange, w3cschools and good blogposts. Let's say that there's a certain piece of code that you don't understand. The best blogposts demonstrated how certain code works by talking about how it works on both a conceptual and practical level. They provide examples of how code works by writing out a small app themselves, displaying it in the blogpost, and providing a link to an online IDE which can be used as a sandbox.

As a coding newbie more accustomed to the hand-holding style of codecademy and coursera, the biggest challenge during this bootcamp has been coping with the [illusion of explanatory depth](https://hbr.org/2012/05/discover-what-you-need-to-know): it's hard to know what terms to use when searching for a solution to given problem if you don't know how to describe what the problem is with precision. Looking for outright solutions is cheating, and often won't get results, so I try to nibble around the edges by having a solution in mind, coding some of it, and filling out the rest with pseudocode. This approach has been moderately successful.

For the times when I haven't been able to find a solution to what ails me, my mentor has been there. This is part of what makes Bloc a good program - you can send a message to your mentor and he or she can direct you to a useful resource, write an explanation themselves, or later on in the week, can take the time to show you how things work.
