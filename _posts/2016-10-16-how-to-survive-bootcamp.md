title: How to Survive Bootcamp
---

You've gotten into your bootcamp, and now you're wondering if you made the right decision. Maybe the bootcamp is too fast paced for you. Maybe you feel like you're not learning enough, and failing the assignments. Maybe you feel like every time something new is introduced, it feels like you're starting over from the beginning, even though you went through the pre-course material. Congratulations, and welcome to the club!

That being said,

* Ask Specific Questions

Asking good questions is all about putting questions you have into specific contexts. The more contexts you can situate a question into, the more possible answers you can receive, and the more angles you get to attack your problem.

* Look For Outside Resources
